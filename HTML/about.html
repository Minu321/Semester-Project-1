      <p>
        Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
        understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
        from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself. The
        aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the
        wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to
        continue the exploration of the world around us. <br />
        We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought
        to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
        exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of
        these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to
        see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits - they only
        come to life at night when everyone's gone home).
